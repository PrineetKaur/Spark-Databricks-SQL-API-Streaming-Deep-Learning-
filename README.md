# Spark-Databricks-SQL-API-Streaming-Deep-Learning 

## (Individual project from my Big Data Analytics Master's 2020 batch)

A PySpark / Databricks combining **SQL queries, API integration, streaming pipelines, and deep learning inference**.  
This repository contains multiple scripts (developed as assignments during a Master’s program in Big Data Analytics) that demonstrate how to build scalable data workflows on Spark.

## 📖 Project Overview

This repository showcases how Spark and Databricks can be used to solve real-world data engineering and machine learning challenges.  
The assignments demonstrate:

- Batch and streaming **data ingestion**  
- **Spark SQL** transformations and queries  
- Calling **external APIs** from Spark pipelines  
- Applying **deep learning models** for inference on streaming data  

It is designed as an educational project but can also be a reference for developers starting with Spark + ML pipelines.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites & Setup

#### You’ll need the following installed:

- Python 3.7+  
- Apache Spark (or a Databricks environment)  
- Python libraries (install via pip):  

	```
 	pip install pyspark pandas numpy requests tensorflow torch

- Optional: Access to Databricks cluster or streaming data source (Kafka/socket/files)

#### Set environment variables as needed:

 	 export SPARK_HOME=/path/to/spark
 	 export PYTHONPATH=$SPARK_HOME/python:$PYTHONPATH
